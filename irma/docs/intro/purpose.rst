Purpose
-------

IRMA provides its users with the ability to objectively assess whether content
is malicious or not. Content may be delivered by various means as described in
this document, and subsequently distributed to various configurable analysis
engines ("probes"). After analysis, this information is then conveyed to the
user.

In addition to this core functionality, IRMA provides an overview of the overall
analysis process and incident.

Finally, IRMA is designed to be installed and maintained in self-contained
on-premises environment. This enables discreet and self-contained analysis for
organizations which do not wish to disclose potentially confidential files to
third parties.

The ultimate purpose of IRMA is to orchestrate the entire analysis process and
provide organizations with a flexible platform with which to manage and asses
the content flowing through their organizations.
