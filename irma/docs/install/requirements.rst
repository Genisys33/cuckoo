Hardware requirements
=====================

The IRMA platform is divided in three major components: the **Frontend**, the
**Brain** and one or multiple **Probes**.

These three components can be installed on a unique host or on multiple hosts,
according to the kind of probes that are being used.

The **Frontend** and the **Brain** must be installed on a GNU/Linux
systemÂ [#]_. Quarkslab recommends using a Debian Stable distribution which is
supported and known to work.

According to the kind of probes and their dependencies, each analyzers can be
installed on a separate hosts or share the same host as far as they do not
interfere with each other [#]_. Currently, only Debian Stable and Microsoft
Windows 8 and 10 hosts have been tested.


Quarkslab does not provide any estimates regarding performance. However,
the following configuration is known to provide reasonable performance for small deployments:

whole IRMA platform on a single machine by hosting it with multiple systems
inside virtual machines: this setup gives fairly high throughput as long as
it has reasonable IO (ideally, SSDs), and a good amount of memory (test setup
was an i7 cpu with 16 GB ram on regular drives (at least 200 GB required),

For larger deployments, the following configuration is known to work:
a single high-memory machine, with 16+ cores, and SSDs, could run IRMA platform and
bear the workload load with reasonable response time.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] Theorically, it should be possible, with some efforts, to make IRMA work
       on Microsoft Windows systems as most of the components used for the platform
       are known to work or to have equivalents on these systems.
.. [#] For instance, we managed to host several GNU/Linux anti-viruses on an
       unique probe by preventing it to launch daemons at startup. This is
       difficult for Microsoft systems on which it is not recommended to
       install multiple anti-viruses on a single host.
.. [#] with a limited set of probes
